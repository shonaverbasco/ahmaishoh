As a to-be former NVIDIA owner, what should I do to prepare my system for an AMD GPU, and eventual CPU, when it arrives. I just installed Linux on my laptop (Kubuntu 18.10) and was wondering if I needed to install any drivers other than the Nvidia driver. The computer is a Dell G7-7588. Hi guys, I am looking at putting together this kit and I am looking for the downfalls I might run into. I'd love to have an "Old Hand" take a peek. The last computer I built was a full tower many years ago, so this NUC is weirding me out a little bit. I intend to set this up and forget about tweaking the hardware for the next 5 years at least amp#x200B; Parts list seems pretty easy: The Hades Canyon NUC itself - I decided on the 8i7HVK for the extra kick. amp#x200B; Wondering if there is a way how to install new Intel Windows 10 DCH Drivers on XPS 9560? Last Intel GPU drivers on Dell support website is from 15 May 2018, almost a year ago. https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28646/Intel-Graphics-Windows-10-DCH-Drivers?product=97503. 
I've been trying to get this to work for the past 24 hours straight, please help: amp#x200B; I built a new PC for streaming live events. Specs are: I7 8700 16g DDR 4 (Gskill) GTX1060 6G Asus WS Z390 Pro Samsung 256g NVME for boot (no recording drives connected at the moment) Windows 10 pro 1809 amp#x200B; There is nothing on the pc but windows (and the drivers it comes with) and NDI tools 3.8. I've reinstalled windows 9 times so far. amp#x200B; Hi, I'm experiencing multiple driver issues with my XPS 9570. The UHD graphics 630 driver from Dell (6471) doesn't have the Intel graphics control panel and the one from the Windows Store doesn't work as it says there is no driver detected. Attempting to install the latest version (6577) from the Intel website gives an error that this driver is not validated for my system. What the fuck? I need the control panel to turn off the abominal automatic brightness "feature" from Intel, where I did a quick search for this and I mostly found results for Surface computers (which my computer isn't, it's a custom built desktop with a Coffee Lake CPU/Z370 mobo). So is this thing safe to download? And if it is, why is it suddenly appearing after a whole year? Also, I'm on version 1809 if that changes anything. Edit: Thanks y'all. 
Hi, I will provide an image here soon but I have he Asus Maximus VII mobo, i7 4790k, and I’m using the disk that came with my mobo to install my drivers but my LAN driver won’t download. After I click “Install Drivers and Software,” I get prompted with “d:\drivers\lan\intel\APPS\PROSETDX\winx64\DXSETUP.EXE is not a valid Win32 application.” And idk what this means but i wasn’t prompted this the last time I installed my lan driver. I have windows 7 home premium 64bit. The only difference. Hi everyone, looking for some advice. amp#x200B; XPS 9570 4k w/Touch I7 - 8750H 16gb Ram Samsung NVME SSD GTX 1050 Ti amp#x200B; I recently got into the XPS world because I needed a laptop with a keyboard that really fit me for studying. Boy did I underestimate what I was getting into. I was making good progress fixing all the issues like installing KSMRD to fix sound drivers, undervolting, etc. however I seem to of hit a brick wall. A few days ago I started getting Feedback is a critical part of how AMD delivers great products. You have made it clear we have room for improvement on graphics driver updates for AMD Ryzen Mobile processor-based notebooks, both for APU-only platforms and discrete GPU notebook designs. It is important to understand that our graphics drivers are typically tailored for specific OEM platforms, so releasing generic APU graphics drivers across all AMD Ryzen mobile processor-based mobile systems could result in less-than-ideal i am so sick of seeing this blasted 're0 watchdog timeout' error. everytime i go to copy something from the NAS while it is writing, say from a torrent feed, it borks and hangs. something as simple as trying to open a folder this morning froze the thing completely and i had to reboot. this is bonkers. how the hell do i fix this nonsense. I just got my laptop back from having it's screen replaced at pcspecialist and there's a bit of an issue with the way things look in games and videos? I'm trying to play bloodborne, eso, watch things on crunchyroll and netflix and despite the highest quality settings and all my drivers up to date, all dark coloured things are blocky and pixelated. Also for some reason most of the time I can't change the brightness settings? I have to restart the laptop to be able to change the brightness. Just installed Xfce on a fresh system, but there are big problems. Firstly, the mouse cursor does not appear at all, despite being movable and functional. Any open windows don't have title bars and are not movable. Shortcuts like Alt-Tab aren't working, and even the wallpaper can't change - it just stays black. Obviously it looks like some graphical thing is missing, but I fully installed the Xfce package without excluding anything. I start it from the console with the usual startxfce4 command. I randomly decided to try and open it because ever since I first downloaded it, it just wouldn't run. I used it to turn off the Display Power Saving Technology "feature". I'm on a SL2 but it should work on all devices. So today windows update did an update (something about Intel system) and now my audio doesn't work. In manage devices I have a warning in OED intel smart sound technology (configuration mismatch) and in Intel high definition audio. I tried deleting realtek audio and reinstalling it but it doesn't work :/ Update: BIOS 1.10.0 fixed the issue </p>
